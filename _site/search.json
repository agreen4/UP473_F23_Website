    "text": "Assignment\nFor this assignment, you will investigate the intersection between housing and a topic or area of your choosing. A few examples of some potential intersections you might explore are:\n\nOngoing housing instability issues for renters\nHousing affordability for college graduates\nHousing displacement due to climate change\nRelationship between housing affordability and eviction\nCapital investment in housing in “shrinking” cities\nDesign of green low-income housing\n\nThis assignment is (purposefully) left quite open. You have a lot of flexibility in defining an area of your interest and then exploring its intersection with our course focus on housing - of course, this flexibility makes your task more challenging! Your challenge is to identify an intersection that strikes a balance between being sufficiently specific that you can adequately reflect upon it, without being so specific that you are unable to identify supporting evidence for your exposition. As you are researching potential intersections, please bring ideas and questions to our class. Your professor and fellow students are an important resource for appropriately scoping your assignment. Along those lines, proactively working on your assignment will greatly increase the odds that you will have sufficient time to explore and research your intersection thoroughly."

The paper should describe and discuss the following dimensions of your intersection:\n\n\nWhat ideas or theoretical concepts describe the two things that you are looking at? What ideas or theoretical concepts describe their intersection?\n\nFor example, if you were exploring differential impacts of climate change on housing for African-American households, you may wish to reference how classical perspectives on economics might explain how risk is factored into housing prices and how theories of environmental justice explain increased exposures of minority populations to degraded and risky environments.\n\nWhat are the policy implications for your intersection? How have policies historically engaged with this issue (if historical policies exist)? How do current policies engage with this issue (if they exist)?\n\nThinking about the intersection of climate change on housing for African-American households, you might discuss access to flood insurance or other means of mitigating physical and financial risk. You might also discuss some of the ongoing debates around planned retreat due to sea level rise.\n\nWhat are your thoughts about the direction that policy may / should go in regards to your issue?"

    "section": "",
    "text": "In seeking to intervene in local and regional housing environments, housing policy analysts face the challenge of describing past and present housing dynamics while also looking towards the future. This assignment asks you to practice these skills by developing an in-depth understanding of a regional housing market of your choice.\nAt a most basic level, housing policy analysts have to\n\ndescribe the geography and composition of the housing market(s) they are analyzing;\ndescribe who gets what housing in those markets; and,\ndescribe the economic environment in which the housing markets operate.\n\nAfter distilling salient trends and features, housing policy analysts can then identify the overall health and function of the housing market, likely future influences, and identify populations that require particular care or intervention.\nIn this assignment, you will begin defining and exploring a U.S. housing market of your choice, focusing on current conditions and housing market trends within the last 10 years. You will make use of the Local Housing Solutions Housing Needs Assessment tool as a primary resource containing salient data for your place.\nUsing this information, describe the local housing market, its demographic and economic conditions, and likely future influences. Based upon your analysis, identify one or more specialized populations and briefly describe their housing needs.\nYour housing market analysis should describe the following:\n\nDemographic Conditions: What are the salient demographic characteristics of the households in your housing market?\nEconomic Conditions: What local or regional economic conditions shape the housing environment?\nFuture Influences:Based upon the recent past, what are likely future influences within the local housing market?\nSpecialized Population Needs: Based upon your analysis of demographic conditions, economic conditions, and housing market trends, what specialized populations emerge who are particularly likely to face housing vulnerability in the future or who will be disparately impacted by the future influences you identify?\n\n\nThe Deliverable \nPrepare your profile as a memorandum of approximately 4,000 words (8 single-spaced pages, excluding tables, illustrations, and references). Your memorandum should include sufficient analysis and properly referenced evidence for another housing market expert to measure the strength and validity of your assertions. The judicious use of maps, imagery, and tables should be included to support your analysis.\nIn preparing your analysis, you may want to first look for other recent analyses of your local market. Good starting places would be to search for the most recent Analysis of Impediments to Fair Housing, local Analysis of Fair Housing, HUD Comprehensive Housing Market Analysis, or for housing analysis completed as part of a neighborhood, local, or regional plan.\nPlease also note that I am not specifying or constraining the geography which you are required to conduct your analysis at. In selecting a particular geography, you’ll need to think carefully about what make sense – how does a particular geography constitute a housing market (or series of submarkets)? You will need to describe the definition you select and will need to justify your choice. Once you do, you should also plan to compare the characteristics of your local housing market (however you define it) to its region and the state in which it’s located.\nI encourage you to reach out to me as you work to define your market, to get confirmation that you have selected an appropriate geography. Keep in mind that you will be working with this selection over the course of the semester for your remaining assignments in the class.\n\n\nSupplemental Data Resources and Analytical Guidance\nI suggest you use the Local Housing Solutions Housing Needs Assessment tool to help you generate baseline data for your analysis. You may wish to supplement data from the Local Housing Solutions website with other data sources.\nData from The Census Bureau’s American Community Survey (ACS) is the first place to look for data that will help you to describe your housing market. The data.census.gov website allows you to query data for different survey years and geographies.\nBelow, you will find helpful information including ACS table numbers (e.g. the population table is B01003) as well as guidance on analytical steps you may wish to take:\n\nPopulation Demographics\nExamine the demographic characteristics for your place and describe who lives here. Explore other ACS tables that may prove insightful. In reporting out demographic conditions, produce your own summaries of elements from ACS tables instead of reporting tables verbatim.\n\n\n\nINDICATOR\nACS TABLE NUMBER\n\n\n\n\nPopulation\nB01003\n\n\nRace\nB02001\n\n\nLatino Ethnicity\nB03002\n\n\nAge\nB01001\n\n\nHousehold Size\nB25010\n\n\nForeign Born Population\nB05002\n\n\n\n\n\nEconomic Conditions\nDetermine the median income for your housing market, as well as the incomes for those earning 120%, 80%, 50%, and 30% of median income\n\n\n\nINDICATOR\nACS TABLE NUMBER\n\n\n\n\nMedian Household Income\nB19013\n\n\nVacancy Rate\nB25002\n\n\n\n\n\nTrends by Tenure\nDetermine housing affordability for renters and owners at median income, 120%, 80%, 50%, and 30% of median income (remember that the federal standard for housing affordability is 30% of median income). Your analysis should compare monthly income to the median rent and owner costs (which are reported as monthly statistics) to determine for which percentages of median income the median priced housing unit is affordable.\nDetermine what percentage of median income is required to be able to afford the median rent and mortgage payments in your housing market.\n\n\n\nINDICATOR\nACS TABLE NUMBER\n\n\n\n\nTenure\nB25003\n\n\nMedian Rent\nB25064\n\n\nMedian Owner Costs\nB25088\n\n\n\n\n\nFuture Influences\nYou may wish to examine future influences. One way to do this would be to perform some very crude projections of housing characteristics. Some examples of approaches you may wish to take:\n\nBased upon housing costs in 2010 and 2020, project housing costs for owners and renters to the year 2030.\nBased upon the median income in 2010 and 2020 project median income for 2030. What percentile of median income will be required in 2030 to afford to rent a median priced housing unit? What percentile of median income will be required to pay the mortgage on a median housing unit?\n\n\n\nPerforming Simple Projections\nTo perform such an analysis, use a crude method like linear projection. For example, find the rate of change over time between two past time periods, and then use this rate of change to extrapolate a future value.\nOne of the simplest methods of projection is to fit a line between two sets of observed points, and then project future values based upon that line.\nYou may remember from your past geometry training that the slope of a line can be calculated as follows:\n\\[slope = \\frac{(y_2−y_1)}{(x_2−x_1)}\\]\nLet’s calculate the change in population for a hypothetical location called Busytown. In 2010, the population of Busytown was 8,000 and by 2020 the population was 9,750. Here’s how we would find the annual rate of population change for Busytown between 2010 and 2020:\n\\[change=\\frac{(9,750−8,000)}{(2020−2010)}=\\frac{1,750}{10}=175\\]\nBusytown’s population increased by 1,750 over 10 years – an average increase of 175 people per year. If we assume that future population will grow at the same rate per year, we can now calculate the future population for Busytown in any future time period:\n\\[PopulationFuture=PopulationBase+(Change∗TimePeriods)\\]\nHere’s the equation for Busytown assuming a base year of 2020, and projecting the population to 2030, which is 10 years in the future:\n\\[Population_{Future}=9,750+(175∗10)=11,500\\]\nTherefore, we project that if the population grows at the same rate it did between 2010 and 2020, the total population will be 9,750 + 1,750 = 11,500 in 2030.\n\n\n\nAssignment Submission\nPlease submit your paper electronically via Canvas."

Your analysis should be directed towards a professional audience consisting of planners and other decision-makers, and should be appropriately targeted towards institutions and decisionmakers that best correspond to the geography(ies) which are dictated by the issues which your policy targets.\nYour analysis needs to accomplish several things:\na. Policy Overview – provide a detailed description of the elements of the policy. Through what mechanisms does it create change? How does it interface with other existing policies? How does it relate to the policies you reviewed in Section 2?\nb. Local Precedents – what preexisting goals, policies, or plans support the adoption of your policy?\nc. Eligibility or Impact Criteria – how will the policy selectively target populations at need? How does targeting meet policy goals without creating the potential for disparate impact?\nd. Spatial Impact – which areas, neighborhoods, and populations will be impacted by your policy? How different is your policy’s prospective impact across space?\ne. Timeline, Outcomes and Measures – what are the intended outcomes to be observed if your policy is successfully implemented? Over what period of time will implementation occur? Describe intended outcomes in terms of hard numbers or targets (e.g. 5,000 more affordable housing units serving households at 50%-80% AMI in 10 years). What measures or indicators are the most important ways to identify the success (or failure) of your policy?\nf. Cost and Impact – provide a rough estimate of the cost of your proposal. How does this cost compare to continuing in the current fashion (business as usual)? How does this cost (and related benefits) accrue over the next 5, 10, and 20 years?\nPlease note that there are slightly different outputs from this assignment for undergraduate and graduate students (listed below)."

    "section": "Basic Communication Strategies",
    "text": "Basic Communication Strategies\n\nMemo Format\nMemos are often used by urban planners to share information within their agency or with other planners and local government officials. Memos tend to be concise documents that may contain either requested information for staff or recommendations on how to debate or take action around a particular policy issue. Memos are built around clear and concise writing with a logical structure, clear illustrations and visualizations, proper formatting and spelling.\nMemos start with a heading that includes the name of the memo author, name of the intended recipient, date, and a descriptive subject heading:\nMemorandum\n\nTo: Janet Jacobs, Planning Director\nFrom: Mae Q. Plannington, Planner 1\nDate: January 7, 2023\nSubject: Recommendation on Zoning Change for Holloway Parcel\nA memo is typically written in response to something. The first paragraph of the memo should describe what the memo is responding to, and should summarize what the writer of the memo has done to prepare the response. The first paragraph should also summarize any key findings or recommendations.\nInformation within a memo should be organized in a logical fashion. Section headings with descriptive titles help your audience find particular information more easily.\nGeneral information should be presented first followed by more detailed information. As you support information with evidence, you should follow the same progression of general to specific.\nMemos should conclude with a summary statement that encapsulates the key findings which you have come up with. If you are providing recommendations in your memo, this is also an appropriate place to re-state your recommendations, and provide instructions for how your memo recipient should follow up.\nBecause a memo is designed to be a concise document, you may have important additional information which would be useful to share, but which does not fit within the scope of the memorandum. Such items can be included in an appendix or attachment to the memo, and should be referenced as appropriate within the memo (e.g. “See the attached document for the property surveyor’s description of the Holloway parcel”).\n\n\nShort Report Format\nPresent your analysis in the format of a short report or “data brief.”\n\n\nDo Not Include Title Page\nTitle pages have their place in academic papers and larger, formal technical reports. However, they are inappropriate for memos and short data or policy briefs. Keep it simple.\n\n\nAvoid Headers and Footers in Memos\nRunning footers and headers also have their place for certain types of documents, but not for memos.\n\n\nNo Conclusion Needed\nIn other contexts, you have likely been taught to include both introductions and conclusions as ways to help transition in and out of different sections. The memo format is more direct, and does not require the use of opening and closing paragraphs. State you case and let it go at that.\n\n\nNotes and Citations\n\nUse Notes for Technical Explanations\nFootnotes or endnotes are best for stating brief technical explanations for methods and data. Reports may require a longer methodological appendix, but this is typically not appropriate for a memorandum.\n\n\nUse Notes for Citations\nUse an endnote or footnote to cite sources for memos and report briefs. Bibliographies or “Works Cited” lists are appropriate for longer reports or academic papers.\n\n\nCombine Data Source Citations\nIt makes good sense to use endnotes or footnotes to discuss data used in an analysis in a memo or report brief. But you do not necessarily need to use a separate note for each data source or series. Instead, combine them by introducing one note early in the document. Something like: “The data used in this analysis are from the U.S. Census Bureau’s 2020 5-year American Community Survey and 2020 Census Household Pulse Survey”.\n\n\n\nFormatting Considerations for Printing\nIncreasingly, memos and other routine planning communications are communicated digitally, however, it is important to prepare documents that will be legible when printed. In most circumstances, formatting considerations for printing will also apply to documents intended to be communicated digitally.\n\nLeft Justify Text\nUse left justification for text, and not full justification.\n\n\nInclude Page Numbers\nInclude page numbers in the bottom center or bottom right of your page.\n\n\nOne Inch Margins\nUse one inch margins on the left, right, top and bottom, including on all pages with tables and figures.\n\n\nTwelve point font\nUse a twelve point font, preferably something like Times for your text. You can use a ten point font for footnotes and endnotes. No text should be smaller than ten points."

    "text": "Style\n\nAwkward Sentence Construction\nA catch-all category for a painful-to-read but not necessarily grammatically incorrect sentence. Sentence may be an affront to good writing style. Admittedly, professors often put AWK in places where they know something is amiss, but not being writing instructors, they’re not sure technically how to explain what is wrong. Bottom line: the sentence doesn’t work. Proofread yourself and then have someone else read to ensure clarity.\n\n\nWrite Directly\nDon’t mince words: come out and say it. Instead of “The BLS and BEA data show that employment in the microchip industry is very small,” write “Employment in the microchip industry is very small.” Or, instead of “It is very important to note that data disclosure rules preclude reporting employment for all sectors,” write “Data disclosure rules preclude. . .”\n\n\nAvoid Excessive Use of Jargon\nAvoid the planner’s pitfall: too much use of all those fancy planning terms and acronyms. It’s not impressive or erudite, just boring.\n\n\nAvoid Passive Voice\nThe extensive use of passive voice may be the single most common reason why a majority of sane individuals would rather walk on hot coals than read a technical document. Doesn’t “The region’s population growth dramatically outpaced the nation’s over the study period” sound better than “Using population data, it was found that the region grew much faster than the US over the study period”?\nAnother example: replace “A three-part analysis will be conducted in this paper” with “This paper will present a three-part analysis” or “In this paper, I will conduct a three-part analysis.” Reject passivity. Be active.\n\n\nUse Active Headings and Subheadings\nUse headings and subheadings to help organize your findings and discussion. In addition, keep ’em active and efficient. Instead of “Location Quotient Analysis” as a sub-heading, try a short title that conveys findings, e.g., “Region Specialized in Manufacturing and Services.” Headings and subheadings should never extend beyond one line of text.\n\n\nAvoid Unnecessary Equivocation\nSometimes it makes sense to offer caveats or otherwise “hedge your bets” when discussing a finding. However, don’t overdo it. Population growth doesn’t “seem fast.” It either is or is not fast, relative to something else (which you should be comparing it to). A location quotient indicates whether a region is or is not specialized in a given industry; it does not indicate that the region “seems specialized” or “may be specialized.” On the other hand, location quotients do not say much beyond specialization (you would not damn the torpedoes and argue, on the basis of a manufacturing LQ above 1.2, that the region is “highly competitive” in manufacturing).\nIf you find yourself making equivocations, it’s worthwhile to revisit the evidence you’ve provided to make a point to ensure you’re making the strongest argument possible. Communicate that argument confidently, and provide appropriate caveats when necessary.\n\n\nIn Memos, Don’t Stay What You’re Going to Say\nIn academic papers or longer reports it often makes sense to provide a roadmap to the document (e.g., “This report begins by summarizing major trends in population. It then. . .”). The adage that you should “say what you are going to say, say it, then say what you said” doesn’t apply for short policy and analysis pieces. Just get on with the analysis and findings. Strong organization and active headings will help your reader infer how you’ll make your points.\n\n\nPlaces Don’t Have Agency\nIn discussing social, economic, and demographic trends for neighborhoods, cities and regions, avoid implying that places have “agency.” Example:\nEl Paso shifted its population mix in response to major changes in Federal immigration policy.\nIn this case, El Paso as a collective, is being treated as an actor when it is actually simply a place with a collection of actors (people, households, businesses, organizations) who are reacting to the federal policy change in various ways.\nIt would be more accurate to say something like this:\nEl Paso’s population mix shifted in response to major changes in Federal immigration policy.\nThere may be cases when implying the place is an actor makes sense, for instance when you are discussing a community-wide strategy or policy.\n\n\nDiscuss Findings, Not Exhibits\nPeople don’t want to read about figures and tables. They want to read about trends that matter from your analysis. Avoid discussing exhibits. Instead, discuss findings, referring to figures and tables as supporting evidence.\nNo: “Figure 1 shows that poverty in center city neighborhoods in Cleveland is increasing.”\nYes: “Poverty in center city Cleveland is increasing (see Table 1).”"

    "section": "Usage",
    "text": "Usage\n\nPrint and Proof\nWe increasingly have an imperative to produce, edit, and disseminate our work using a completely electronic workflow. This has its benefits, but you need to develop a workflow that allows you to edit your draft with diligence. Printing and proofing a document by hand can often catch errors that would otherwise become lost in digital copy - such mistakes often reveal themselves in embarrassingly stark relief once disseminated.\n\n\nDefine Acronyms on First Use\nThe first time you use an acronym (e.g., HUD), spell it out, followed by the acronym in parentheses. “Data are from the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD).” Then use the acronym to your heart’s content.\n\n\nWrite out Numbers Less than 11\nAlthough sometimes the convention is that numbers one through ninety-nine should be spelled out. Numerals should be used for rates, percentages and other “data” indicators. Thus we would write “there are eight counties in the MSA,” but “the region grew by 8 percent.”\n\n\nSpell out Numbers Starting Sentences\nAny number that begins a sentence (or a bullet point) should be spelled out.\n\n\nWatch Your Capitalization\nNo need to capitalize industries, occupations, or other sectoral-type categories. Do not over-capitalize. Note that when referring to a single county, write “Tehama County.” But writing about multiple counties, it is “Tehama and Shasta counties.” Also: the “City of New York” but the “cities of Palo Alto and San Jose.”\n\n\nNo Apostrophe on Dates\nWhen referring to decades (e.g., 1990s), do not use an apostrophe.\n\n\nData are Plural\nNo: “The data is hard to find.”\nYes: “The data are hard to find.”\n\n\nUse Proper Note Punctuation\nNote numbers are best placed at the end of a sentence outside the punctuation.\nYes: This is a sentence that requires a citation.1\nNo: This is a sentence that requires a citation2.\n\n\nComplete Sentences in Notes\nFootnotes and endnotes should be complete sentences. Complete sentences have punctuation at the end.\n\n\nPunctuation Inside Quotes\nPunctuation generally goes inside quotes.\nYes: “Run, Tom, run,” said Jane.\nNo: “Down, Spot, down”, said Percival, Dick’s little-known cousin from Topeka.\n\n\nWrite out Percent\nOne of the few times the “less ink is better” rule is violated. Write “8 percent,” not “8%.” It’s less distracting to the eye.\n\n\nUse Arabic Numbers for Notes\nMicrosoft Word often defaults to the use of Roman numerals for notes and endnotes (i, ii, iii. . .). Change this option and use Arabic numerals. More efficient.\n\n\nCiting the URL is Not Enough\nIn the Internet age it has become distressingly common practice to cite only the URL for online documents. But consider this: if you quoted Tolstoy’s War and Peace using a copy you checked out from the New York Public Library, you would not cite the library as the source. The same principle applies to the Internet. For web sites, which are inherently Internet-based, you should list the name of the cite and then the URL. For documents accessed online, you should cite in the usual way (author, date, title, etc.) and then include the URL. Note that you are not obligated to list the URL for freestanding documents if you include the complete citation otherwise.\n\n\nAvoid Ampersand (&) in Text\nThe symbol “&”, known as the ampersand, should not be used in your text write-up. It is ok to use it for labels in tables and figures."

    "section": "Numbers",
    "text": "Numbers\n\nInterpret Quantities by Comparison\nDo not just report growth rates, quantities and other indicators for individual places. They are hard to interpret by themselves. For example, to back up a claim that your region has faced substantial population growth in the last decade, contrast its growth rate with the national average growth rate.\n\n\nExplain Regional Geography\nThe first time you mention your region, explain–either in the text or in a note–what its geographic composition is (e.g., its counties).\n\n\nSignificant Digits\nUse numbers with levels of precision that match the realistic precision in the underlying data. Should a location quotient be expressed as 1.709? No. Round to the nearest tenth (1.7). Percentage growth rates for subnational areas are also usually best expressed with one decimal place. Shares can be converted to percentages and expressed to one decimal place to make them more readable.\n\n\nOnly Include Exhibits You Reference in Text\nNo table, figure, chart or line drawing should be included in the report or report appendix unless it is referenced somewhere in the text discussion. That reference may be very brief (“see Table 4”), but it has to be there (it could also be in an endnote or footnote). Think of it this way: if it wasn’t important enough for you to mention it, why did you include it?\n\n\nReport the Quantity\nSometimes it is easy to forget to report the variable levels when we are analyzing variable trends. For example, it is common in analyses of wage trends (“wages are on the up and up”) to find nary a mention of wage levels. As a reader, you are left wondering “wages are going up, but are they high or low?” It is better to ground an analysis of changes in a given variable with a mention of the levels of the variable. So “The current annual average wage in River City for production workers is $27,500. That is up 12 percent in real terms since 1997. By contrast, the average production worker wage nationwide increased by 16.5 percent. . .”\n\n\nEmphasize Significant Findings\nWhen analyzing data we are looking for the most significant findings and often a “story” that helps explain those findings. In descriptive analysis, significance is often first assessed not in a statistical sense, but by looking for high and low values or major changes. But not all high/low values or large changes are necessarily important from a policy or planning point of view. Be careful to think through the potential implications of a finding before discussing it. Ask yourself: “So what?” If you can’t think of an answer, leave it out. (Example: “Since 1990, River City’s unemployment rate has registered below the U.S. rate in every quarter except IIQ 1996 and IVQ 1998” might be better stated as “River City’s unemployment rate has registered below the U.S. rate in 54 of the last 56 quarters.” A subtle change but the reader is not left asking: “Hmm, I wonder if I’m supposed to know why it was higher in those two periods?”\n\n\nPercent versus Percentage Points\nLet’s say you’re comparing the U.S. unemployment rate of 5.0 percent to the Peoria unemployment rate of 4.0 percent. Is the Peoria rate 1 percent lower than the national rate? No. It is 1 percentage point lower. A Peoria rate 1 percent lower than the national average would be 4.95 percent.\n\n\nRefer to Exhibits in Text\nRefer to your figures and tables directly in your text. Example: “Table 2 reports employment growth figures for the 1995 to 2003 period.” Or: “Employment growth was particularly strong in the retail and construction sectors (see Table 4).” If you are going to send readers to a table in a parenthetical phrase (like the last example), be sure to include the word “see.” So, you would not write: “Employment growth was particularly strong in the retail and construction sectors (Table 4).”"

    "section": "Tables, Figures and Graphics",
    "text": "Tables, Figures and Graphics\n\nMake ’Em so they Stand Alone\nFigures, graphs and tables should be constructed so that they can stand alone (as much as feasible). That is, someone could pick up and read the table without the accompanying text and get the gist of what it is trying to say. It goes without saying that sources of all data and calculations should be clearly indicated.\n\n\nAvoid Use of Grids in Tables\nThere is almost never any reason to include gridlines on a data table. Putting a line below the column headings and one below the last row of data, followed by the data source, is usually the best approach.\n\n\nDecimal Justify Data Columns\nLine up columns of numbers in tables on their explicit or implicit decimal points. Do not center justify numeric data.\n\n\nUse Descriptive Column Labels in Tables\nRemember the golden rule in table and figure construction: make it stand alone. That means column headings that someone can understand without reading the report body. Sometimes this is hard to do efficiently (headings can get too long). In such cases an alternative is to use short-hand headings but explain what they mean in a footnote to the table.\n\n\nUse Label Hierarchies in Tables\nA good way to make tables more efficient is to use hierarchical labeling of columns. In the table below, employment and payroll data for Illinois were available in 2003. But national and regional data were available only for 2001. The table efficiently reports the 2003 Illinois numbers along with national and Midwest growth rates for 1990-2001 and location quotients for 2001. A note at the bottom of the table should clarify how the Midwest is defined as well as what the reference area is for the location quotient.\n\n\n\nIndicate Source on Figures and Tables\nData sources should be indicated clearly on all figures and tables.\n\n\nUse Detailed Sources\nFor some series simply listing the data provider agency is not enough. For example, BLS reports several employment series. Therefore, list the series within BLS (or other) that you are using. For example, Regional Economic Information System, US Bureau of Economic Analysis, or Covered Wages and Employment, US Bureau of Labor Statistics.\n\n\nPie Chart? No Thanks\nWhile seductive to the eye, pie charts are far less interpretable than a simple bar chart. Go for conveying your findings clearly, not spicing up your document with spurious graphical devices.\n\n\nShun 3-D\nThree dimensional bar charts and other graphics generally should be avoided. They usually compromise proper interpretation of the findings. Keep it simple: no 3-D.\n\n\nCall Tables “Tables” and Figures “Figures”\nBy convention, tables are called “tables” and graphics such as data charts or line drawings are called “figures.” Sometimes people use the word “exhibit” to label a line drawing. Avoid use of the terms “chart” and “graphic” for labels (e.g., Chart 1, Graphic 1). Also, never call a table a figure or a figure a table. Note that exhibit labels are generally capitalized: “Population trends for River City are summarized in Table 4.”\n\n\nSequence Tables and Figures in Order in the Text\nIf you have three tables, do not discuss Table 1, then Table 3, then Table 2. If the results in Table 3 are mentioned prior to those in Table 2, renumber the tables. Same for figures or any other exhibit.\n\n\nUse Commas for Numbers\nIn data tables, include commas in the number formatting to denote significant digits. So: $47,500 instead of $47500.\n\n\nAvoid Grids on Figures\nMany graphical packages default settings include gridlines on charts. Most charts are simple enough not to need them to be clearly interpreted. Get rid of the clutter and save some ink!\n\n\nDon’t Rely on Color\nRemember that your best intents for people to view your document in color may be foiled - some individuals may print documents in grayscale, and others may be colorblind and unable to perceive all colors. That means your document should not depend on color to convey its findings. An example of depending on color would be to use red text in your tables to indicate negative values or any color to highlight interesting trends.\n\n\nReport Numbers in 000s\nIt is ok to report very large numbers in thousands or even millions in tables if the precision in the original units is unnecessary. It is probably not critical in most cases for people to know that the US population changed by 1,456,789 over a given period (1.46 million will probably suffice). For small areas, such as counties and regions, reporting the original units is usually preferred except for large number variables (e.g., total dollar income).\n\n\nNo Superfluous Material\nAvoid the practice of tacking on government documents or tables to your reports as “general points of information.” The idea in most professional writing is to convey maximum information with minimum material; tossing in nonessential material from secondary sources defeats that aim."

    "text": "Collaborate - In Class\nIn class, you’ll split into three groups to work on developing a policy intervention based on one of three scenarios. Here are the descriptions of those three scenarios:\n\nPrompt\nYou are a team of experts working to advise Congress as to what to do about one of these situations. Congress has asked for a short (3 slide) presentation that describes a preferred national policy strategy focused on intervention.\n\nSpend around 10 minutes discussing the problem and thinking about potential policy solutions to recommend to Congress.\nSpend around 10 minutes drafting out your policy strategy.\n\n\nConcept and Rationale - What is the rationale for intervention, what is it designed to do?\nScale - please describe the scale of intervention\nScope - please describe how the intervention will alter supply and demand for housing, and who it is targeted towards\nInstitutions and Actors - please describe which institutions and actors must be involved in the intervention. While some institutions and actors may implicitly be involved, you should describe them explicitly.\n\n\nSpend around 10 minutes designing your presentation which should consist of the following:\n\n\nSlide 1 should describe the problem, and should raise the main questions which experts identified that would help to define the problem.\nSlide 2 should present a visual schematic of the housing system and institutional actors involved in your proposed intervention (similar to the one which we have previously viewed in class).\nSlide 3 should describe desired policy goals and measurable indicators of policy efficacy (success).\n\nYour group will have 10 minutes each to provide recomendations to Congress.\n\n\nScenario 1\nThe country is in the process of recovering from a major recession. At the worst point in that recession, 50 percent of mortgages were in default. At present, the national homeownership rate is around 43 percent. Banks remain wary of making loans, although there is increased demand for housing within cities. The Department of Labor has already established a special homeownership incentive, offering mortgage guarantees for workers under the age of 35, however, many of these workers continue to struggle to find housing they can afford, particularly in cities.\n\n\nScenario 2\nThe country has been gripped by protests regarding the state of race relations and the treatment of minorities by government officials. Cities are largely segregated by race and income, and have been further damaged by looting and rioting. There is strong public demand for fairer treatment, including the desegregation of neighborhoods and integration of schools. The homeownership rate is around 62 percent. Local governments have expressed concern about policies impacting local stability and the prospect of rapid change.\n\n\nScenario 3\nThe country’s social safety net housing stock for low-income individuals is aging and has suffered due to poor maintenance and disinvestment. A spate of very visible news coverage has created public discourse about severe distress of the housing, and has also depicted decaying social conditions. This housing contains some of the highest concentrations of poverty in the country, but is often located near very high-value housing markets, making the land upon which the decaying housing rests very valuable. There is substantial public concern about concentrated poverty, violence, and disorder in these neighborhoods. There is also substantial public and political concern about spending the money necessary to fix up or replace the existing housing with comparable modern units targeted solely for individuals who need the social safety net. The national homeownership rate is around 62 percent."

Within the context of urban planning, housing represents one of the ways in which planning intervention has sought to ensure the health and safety of residents, while also bearing influence on a range of other spatial, social, and economic relationships.\nWithin this class, we will explore policies and practices related to housing and neighborhood wellbeing in the United States and abroad. We will learn how these policies attempt to intervene and shape the physical, economic, social, and political dimensions of our lives."

Late work will be automatically graded down by 5 points per 24-hour period your assignment is late, and will only be accepted if you have made arrangements with me prior to the assignment due date.\n\n\nAttendance\nThe learning environment in this seminar depends upon your participation. Full participation is expected for all course sessions. For each course session that you are absent from (excluding excused absences), 2 percent will be deducted from your final course grade. Excused absences will be granted on a case-by-case basis, but must be approved by me prior to the course session which you are absent from.\nFor those students who need to miss class due to a religious observance, please complete the Request for Accommodation for Religious Observances form should any instructors require an absence letter in order to manage the absence. In order to best facilitate planning and communication between students and faculty, we request that students make requests for absence letters as early as possible in the semester in which the request applies.\nFor more information on attendance policy as described in the University of Illinois Student Code, please see Sections 1-501 and 1-502.\n\n\nAccomodations for Students with Disabilities\nIf you need accommodations for any sort of disability, please make an office hours appointment so we can discuss your needs and ways I can support your learning. To ensure that disability-related concerns are properly addressed, students who require assistance to participate in this class should contact Disability Resources and Educational Services (DRES). DRES provides students with academic accommodations, access, and support services. To contact DRES you may visit 1207 S. Oak St., Champaign, call 333-4603 (V/TDD), or e-mail disability@illinois.edu."

    "text": "Honor Code and Learning Environment\nThe Illinois Student Code states: “It is the responsibility of each student to refrain from infractions of academic integrity, from conduct that may lead to suspicion of such infractions, and from conduct that aids others in such infractions.” Note that you are subject to the Honor Code, as well as procedures for addressing violations to the Code, regardless of whether you have read it and understand it. According to the Code, “ignorance is no excuse.”\nTo meet this standard in this class, note the following: in written work, all ideas (as well as data or other information) that are not your own must be cited. Note that ideas that require citation may not have been published or written down anywhere. While you are free—and indeed encouraged—to discuss the assignments with your peers, all of your data collection, analysis, and writing should be your own. Sharing of data sources you have been assigned to collect is a violation of the honor code in this course. The penalty for failing to meet the principles or spirit of the honor code may include automatic failure of the assignment or the class, at the discretion of the instructor.\nThe Department of Urban and Regional Planning is committed to maintaining a learning environment that is rooted in the goals and responsibilities of professional planners. By enrolling in a class offered by the Department of Urban and Regional Planning, students agree to be responsible for maintaining an atmosphere of mutual respect in all activities, including lectures, discussions, labs, projects, and extracurricular programs. See Student Code Article 1-Student Rights and Responsibilities, Part 1. Student Rights: §1-102.\n\nHealth and Safety\nFollowing University policy, all students are required to engage in appropriate behavior to protect the health and safety of the community. If you feel ill, do not come to class. In addition, if you test positive for COVID-19 or have had an exposure that requires testing and/or quarantine, do not attend class. Please notify me, and at my discretion, you will be given excused absences for these class sessions. We will also develop a plan to discuss how to make up any missed work.\n\n\nStaying in Touch\nAs you learn and face challenges this semester, I need you to communicate with me, either during our course sessions or individually. You can schedule an appointment with me at your convenience via my Calendly page. I promise to listen, to be a resource, and to help in any way that I can - if I can’t help you, I will find someone who can.\n\n\nSexual Misconduct Reporting Obligation\nThe University of Illinois is committed to combating sexual misconduct. Faculty and staff members are required to report any instances of sexual misconduct to the University’s Title IX and Disability Office. In turn, an individual with the Title IX and Disability Office will provide information about rights and options, including accommodations, support services, the campus disciplinary process, and law enforcement options.\nA list of the designated University employees who, as counselors, confidential advisors, and medical professionals, do not have this reporting responsibility and can maintain confidentiality, can be found here. Other information about resources and reporting is available at wecare.illinois.edu.\n\n\nMental Health\nThe University of Illinois offers a variety of confidential services including individual and group counseling, crisis intervention, psychiatric services, and specialized screenings which are covered through the Student Health Fee. If you or someone you know experiences mental health concerns, please contact or visit any of the University’s resources provided below. Getting help is a smart and courageous thing to do for yourself and for those who care about you.\n\nCounseling Center: (217) 333-3704\nMcKinley Health Center: (217) 333-2700\n988 Suicide and Crisis Lifeline: (800) 273-8255\nRosecrance Crisis Line (217) 359-4141\n\nIf you are in immediate danger, call 911."
