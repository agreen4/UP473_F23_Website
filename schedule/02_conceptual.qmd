## Description

During this session, we will explore several key conceptual frameworks for analyzing or understanding housing and urban policy. Over the course of today's conversation, we'll explore six frameworks - spatial distribution, class, demographics, public discourse, rights, and design, in order to question *who shapes housing* and *what does housing shape*.

## Learning Goals

- Think conceptually about the role of housing in society
- Apply previous knowledge of key frameworks for housing analysis to our conversation
- Articulate key questions associated with each framework
