## Description

Our nation's housing delivery system works well for some, but there are other specialized populations that require additional outreach and support. In this session, we will examine the unique housing needs of ageing individuals and those with disabilities, and will explore the range of policy tools and strategies to provide inclusive, long-term housing solutions.

## Learning Goals

-   Recognize common barriers to housing for people with disabilities.
-   Envision how housing policy might respond to the housing needs of an ageing population.
