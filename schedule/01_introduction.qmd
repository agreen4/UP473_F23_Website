## In Class

In class, we will spend some time reading these articles. You will split into small groups to begin exploring their arguments and will work together to develop models of the housing system that relate to the arguments made in the articles. We'll take 10 minutes in class for you to re-familiarize yourself with the article you're going to present, but you may want to read these before class.
